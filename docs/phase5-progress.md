| M4 Incidents API + wiring | | | |
| M5 Live verification | | | Needs Rizwan: checkout-demo rebuild, Operate role |

## M0 (2026-10-12)

Done:
- `docs/phase5-interfaces.md`: evidence, emergency actions (plan + execute), fix PRs, approvals,
  RootCause, incidents API, incident run events, per-scenario expectations, questions for Rizwan.
- Types and 501 routes: `app/agents/medic/{events,schemas}.py`, `app/routes/incident{s,_schemas}.py`.
- Fakes with real approval checks: `FakeEmergencyActions` (`app/actions/fake.py`),
  `FakeFixPullRequests` (`app/tools/github_pr.py`), `FakeEvidence` (`app/telemetry/evidence.py`).
- `ApprovedAction` accepts Medic's action names; incident events stream by name; web types
  regenerated.
- Tests: `tests/test_phase5_contract.py` (18).

Decisions:
- An incident is investigated by a run (`agent="medic"`, `runs.incident_id`); its events are run
  steps with typed `data`, like deploys. The UI reuses the run stream, approvals, and Stop.
- Emergency actions are plan (read-only) then execute (approved), with a state re-check, like
  `Target.rollback_plan()` / `rollback()`.
- Recovery checks reuse the deploy `VerifyResult` payload.
- Fix PRs get their own write allowlist in `app/tools/github_pr.py`; `app/connectors/github.py`
  stays GET only.

Open issues:
- Rizwan's answers to the 7 questions at the end of `docs/phase5-interfaces.md`.
- `tests/test_sandbox.py::test_build_and_smoke_on_a_real_daemon` fails locally (no buildx in the
  local Docker); unrelated, passes where the daemon has buildx.

Spend: $0 (no model, Tavily, AWS, or GitHub calls).
